**Be aware!** This project is on early stages and is barely funcional. **Do not use.**

A Hackable DataFrame library in Swift inspired by Pandas.
A lot of ideas were borrowed from Matrix.swift

## Motivations

- Data Scientists receive all the fun, Machine Learning Engineers do not.
- Simple by design, so you can hack the way you want.
- No index. Index is just a way to mess up your ETL.

## Recomendations
